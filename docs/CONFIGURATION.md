## Multi-language Configuration

### Adding Portuguese Content

Create identical files in `/data/pt/` with Portuguese translations:

```yaml
# data/pt/dojo.yaml
dojo_name: "Dojo Sakura Goju-Ryu"
address: |
  Rua do Karatê, 123
  São Paulo, SP 01234-567
  Brasil
email: "info@sakuragojuryu.com.br"
phone: "+55 (11) 5555-0123"
```

### Adding Other Languages

1. Create new language folder: `/data/es/` (for Spanish)
2. Copy all YAML files and translate content
3. Update `hugo.toml` to include the new language
4. Create content pages in `/content/es/`

## Validation and Testing

### YAML Syntax Check

Use online validators to check your YAML:

- [YAML Lint](https://www.yamllint.com/)
- [Online YAML Parser](https://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/)

### Common Mistakes

1. **Indentation**: YAML is sensitive to spaces

   ```yaml
   # ❌ Wrong
   instructors:
   - name: "John"

   # ✅ Correct
   instructors:
     - name: "John"
   ```

2. **Quotes**: Use quotes for strings with special characters

   ```yaml
   # ❌ Wrong
   description: This has: special characters

   # ✅ Correct
   description: "This has: special characters"
   ```

3. **Multiline Text**: Use `|` for multiple lines
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Correct
   address: |
     123 Main Street
     City, State 12345
     Country
   ```

### Testing Changes

After making changes:

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   hugo server
   ```
2. **Build Test**:

   ```bash
   hugo --gc --minify
   ```

3. **Check for Errors**: Look for YAML parsing errors in terminal output

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

1. **Keep It Current**: Update schedules and instructor information regularly
2. **Be Accurate**: Double-check contact information and addresses
3. **Professional Tone**: Use respectful, martial arts-appropriate language
4. **Consistent Formatting**: Use the same format for ranks, times, etc.

### Maintenance

1. **Regular Reviews**: Check all information quarterly
2. **Backup**: Keep backups of your customized YAML files
3. **Version Control**: Use Git to track changes
4. **Testing**: Test after every significant change

---

**Pro Tip**: Start with minimal information and add details gradually. It's better to have accurate basic information than incomplete detailed information.
